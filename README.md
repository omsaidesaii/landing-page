# landing-page
Built a simple landing page using HTML & CSS! 🎨💻
I recently created a static landing page with some cool CSS transitions & animations. This project helped me explore how small design details can make a webpage feel more interactive and engaging.

Features:
✨ Smooth CSS transitions
🎨 Clean & minimal UI design
💡 Simple but effective hover effects
